# iceCreamNet

An HTML project that serves visitors free ice cream.

### Concept

I believe the experience of receiving and 'tasting' ice cream can be simulated through a procedural process of self-hypnosis. The user will be presented with the simple question of “would you like some ice cream” to gauge the user’s interest, followed by an opportunity to select a flavour. The selection process helps determine the user’s preferences via flavour selection, which increases the probability that the flavour in question is indeed a flavour that the user has enjoyed in the past. We then direct the user to the third act, where the ice cream is 'actually' dispensed on-screen for the user, with instructions on how the user might enjoy said ice cream. This process could incorporate ASMR techniques  to further enrich the experience or even be complimented with VR technology to immerse the user in a more immersive environment where the act of bringing the cone to one’s lips is actualized.
